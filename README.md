# MATTHEW CONNER
## I am a St. Louis native, born and raised. I attended Space Camp in Huntsville, AL where I pursued my dream of becoming an astronaut. I deviated from that path and joined the United States Marines out of high school. After the Marine Corps I worked as a Real Estate agent during which time I had the blessing of a beautiful baby girl named Violet. 
### I intend to strengthen my knowledge of the IT field and create a career that will allow for growth and expansion of my ambitions.
